# remainder.c
User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter two numbers - a dividend and a divisor.

2. **Remainder Calculation**: The program defines a function calculateRemainder that calculates the remainder without using the % operator. It repeatedly subtracts the divisor from the dividend until the dividend becomes less than the divisor, which gives us the remainder.

3. **Output**: After calculating the remainder using the defined function, the program displays the result to the user. For example, if the user enters 17 as the dividend and 5 as the divisor, the program calculates the remainder as 2 and outputs The remainder of 17 divided by 5 is: 2.

4. **Sample Output**:
   - If the user enters 25 as the dividend and 7 as the divisor, the program will calculate the remainder as 4 and output The remainder of 25 divided by 7 is: 4.

By incorporating this explanation along with the code in your project documentation, users will have a clear understanding of how the program calculates remainders without using the % operator.
